#Robots. Twitter. Googly Eyes
A twitter-bot that reads tweets and does actions accordingly.

Twitter-Bot is a social robot that loves to follow all the latest trends in locomotion, such as "forward", -"backward", "left", and "right"!

Twitter-Bot is made from servos, breadboards, and a Raspberry Pi as the brains of the whole outfit. The Twitter client is written in Python, dipping into the Twitter API using Tweepy.

Wanna control the robot? 
Tweet one of the legal commands from ["backward", "forward", "left", "right"] @ BlueberryPii
ex: "@BlueberryPii move forward!", "go left @BlueberryPii!"
